# Advanced Implementation for Providing a Web Service

> Refer to [Quick-Start Implementation](../00-quick-start-implementation/README.md) for documentation on setting up debugging, remote end points, secrets and parameter store access, and caching.

In addition to providing basic debugging, connections, and cache, the Cache-Data package also provides methods to receive, validate, route, respond to, and log requests as a web service much like an advanced framework such as ExpressJS.

A full implementation example and tutorial is provided as one of the Atlantis Application Starters available through the [Atlantis Tutorials repository](https://github.com/63klabs/atlantis-tutorials). (Atlantis is a collection of templates and deployment scripts to assist in starting and automating serverless deployments using AWS SAM and CloudFormation.)
