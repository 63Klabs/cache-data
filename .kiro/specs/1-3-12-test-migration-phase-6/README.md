# Test Migration Phase 6

Any tests written in Mocha that have not yet been migrated to Jest should be migrated to the Jest framework.

Any test area that are lacking ANY class, module, or function should be generated so that it is fully tested.

Care should be taken to not introduce any breaking changes.

Once test coverage has been confirmed, and the migration is considered complete, remove the Mocha tests from the test scripts and dependencies.

Ask clarifying questions in SPEC-QUESTIONS.md in this directory and the user will respond with answers there.
