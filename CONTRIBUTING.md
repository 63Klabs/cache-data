Submit feature requests. To keep this project simple and maintainable we accept features that are generally useful by an overwhelming majority of developers using the project. If you can submit code suggestions or pseudo code that helps! You can also examine a feature request from someone else and provide helpful solutions to the team.

After you have successfully participated in the bug reporting and feature request process, fork the repository and make your changes in a separate branch. Once you're satisfied with your changes, submit a pull request for review. Please only submit small changes (a single feature) at first. Pull requests with major code updates or frequent pull requests will often get ignored. Changes should also have code and testing methods well documented.

While AI-generated code is acceptable, it must be reviewed, understood, and tested by a human before being merged. Kiro is the preferred AI coding assistant as it is in the AWS Ecosystem. Ensure [Kiro steering documents](.kiro/steering/ai-context-reference.md) are reviewed, understood, and used by both humans and AI. Utilize the Spec-Driven, AI-Assisted Engineering approach and avoid Vibe Coding.

Do not disable tests.
Do not change tests.
Do not break the build.
